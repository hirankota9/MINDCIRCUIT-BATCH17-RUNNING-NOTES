ON-PREMISES : What is On-Premises?
============================

On-premises means:
You own and manage everything yourself (your own datacenter) 

This includes:
- Servers (big computers)
- Storage
- Networking equipment
- Power
- Cooling
- Security
- IT staff to maintain it


============================
CLOUD : What is Cloud?
============================

Cloud means:
Using someone else’s computers (servers) over the internet
instead of owning and managing your own.


============================
EXAMPLE: Running a Website
============================

ON-PREMISES:

- Buy a server
- Install OS and software
- Set up networking
- Handle power & cooling
- Fix hardware issues
- Upgrade when traffic grows
- Limited storage - External hard drive or  server
- Limited space
- If it breaks → data loss risk

Result:
- Takes time
- High cost
- Requires expertise


CLOUD:

- Create an account
- Click "Create Server"
- Choose server size
- Pay per hour or usage
- Scale up or down anytime AS PER REQUIREMENT 

Result:
- Fast
- Flexible
- Beginner-friendly


============================
KEY BENEFITS OF CLOUD
(Why Cloud is Popular)
============================

- No hardware to buy
- Pay only for what you use (Ondemand )
- Easy to scale resources
- High availability
- High Scalability
- Faster to start
- Global access from anywhere


============================
WHEN ON-PREMISES IS STILL USED
============================

Some companies prefer on-premises when:

- Strict data security laws exist
- Internet is not reliable
- Legacy systems are in use
- Full control over systems is required

AWS FREE TIER 


AWS Free Tier allows new users to try AWS services
without paying immediately.

It is mainly used for:
- Learning AWS
- Practice
- Small experiments
- Beginners in Cloud


========================================
AWS FREE TIER – CURRENT USAGE MODEL
(NEW ACCOUNTS)
========================================

For new AWS accounts:

- AWS offers a Free Plan with credits
- You can get up to $200 AWS credits
  - $100 at signup
  - Up to $100 by completing learning activities

- Valid for:
  - 6 months
  - OR until credits are used (whichever comes first)

- No charges unless you upgrade to Paid Plan


========================================
IS IT FREE FOR 1 YEAR OR 6 MONTHS?
========================================

- Older AWS accounts (created earlier):
  - Had 12 months Free Tier for many services

- New AWS accounts:
  - Mostly follow 6-month Free Plan with credits

Note:
- AWS model may change over time
- Always check usage limits in AWS console


========================================
ALWAYS FREE SERVICES
(NO EXPIRY – WITH LIMITS)
========================================

Some services are free every month
within certain limits, even after credits end.

Examples:
- AWS Lambda
  - 1 million free requests per month
- Amazon S3
  - Limited free storage
- Amazon DynamoDB
  - Free storage and read/write capacity

(Usage limits apply)


========================================
IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER
========================================

- Credit card is required to create AWS account
- AWS follows pay-as-you-use model
- If you exceed free limits → you will be charged
- Always monitor billing dashboard


========================================
FINAL SUMMARY
========================================

AWS Free Tier is a starter pack for beginners.

Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):
 
 
The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is a set of guidelines that define the structure and organization of directories and files on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It aims to ensure consistency and compatibility between different distributions of Linux, making it easier for software developers, administrators, and users to navigate and understand the file system. Here are the key components of the FHS:

Root Directory (/)
/bin: Essential command binaries that are required for system operation (e.g., ls, cp, mv).

/boot: Files needed for the boot process, including boot loader configuration files and kernels.

/dev: Device files representing hardware devices attached to the system (e.g., /dev/sda for the first SATA drive).

/etc: Configuration files for the system and installed applications (e.g., /etc/passwd for user information).

/home: Home directories for regular users (e.g., /home/ec2-user).

/lib: Shared libraries needed by programs in /bin and /sbin.

/media: Mount points for removable media (e.g., USB drives).

/mnt: Mount points for temporary mounted filesystems.

/opt: Optional software packages that are not part of the operating system distribution.

/sbin: System binaries essential for system administration, typically used by the root user.

/srv: Data for services provided by the system (e.g., web server data).

/tmp: Temporary files that may be deleted between reboots.

/usr: Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of user utilities and applications.

/var: Variable data files, such as logs, spool files, and temporary files that persist between reboots.

---------------------

root --> /
ll
/bin – binary or executable programs.
 /sbin – binary executable programs for an administrator.
/etc – system configuration files.
/home – home directory. It is the default current directory.
/root - home directory of root user 
/opt – optional or third-party software.
/tmp – temporary space, typically cleared on reboot.
/usr – User related programs.
/var – log files.

=========================================================

df ( disk filesystem)  -
          It is used to report file system disk space usage, showing how much space is used and available on mounted file systems.


df -h 
df -m 

In Windows, drives such as C:, D:, and E: are logical designations assigned to storage devices or partitions. Each drive letter represents a separate filesystem namespace, allowing users and applications to access files and directories on that specific storage unit. 


In Linux, the concept of drive letters like C:, D:, and E: does not exist. Instead, Linux uses a single hierarchical directory structure that begins at the root directory (/). All storage devices, partitions, and network filesystems are integrated into this hierarchy by mounting them at specific directories


df 
df -h
df -m 

----------------------------------------------------------

du -h <foldername/filename>

du -sh 
 
----------------------------------------------------------
change the ownership of files and directories.:


chmod (FILE PERMISSIONS) 

The chmod command in Linux is used to change the file permissions. Permissions dictate who can read, write, or execute a file. Here's a comprehensive guide on using the chmod command:


There are three types of users:

u – the file owner (user)
g – the group to which the file belongs
o – others - everyone else 
a – all (user, group, and others)

------------------
change the permissions of a file or directory --  madhu 

owner/user    |  group  | others 

rwx               rwx     rwx 

r - read - 4
w - write - 2
x - execute - 1 


Modes
Modes can be specified using symbolic or numeric (octal) notation.

Symbolic Notation
r – read permission
w – write permission
x – execute permission



Numeric (Octal) Notation
4 – read permission
2 – write permission
1 – execute permission

The numeric mode is a combination of these values. For example:

7 – read, write, and execute (4 + 2 + 1)
6 – read and write (4 + 2)
5 – read and execute (4 + 1)
4 – read only




chmod -R 


Make a script executable:
Secure private SSH keys:
Set directory to allow access only to owner:
================================================

What is a Group?
A group is a collection of users. It helps manage permissions for multiple users efficiently.

Each file in Linux is owned by:

One user (owner)

One group

==========================================
/etc/passwd	------   Stores user info (usernames, UID, shell, home)
/etc/group	-------  Lists groups and their members
/etc/shadow	------    Stores encrypted passwords
==================================================================
Shared Directory for Team::

groupadd team
usermod -aG team madhu
usermod -aG team kiran
mkdir /project
chown root:team /project
chmod 770 /project

======================================

CHOWN :

change the ownership of files and directories.

FILE & DIRECTORY OWNERSHIP :

The chown command in Linux is used to change the ownership of files and directories. This command allows you to change both the user and group ownership of a file or directory.

chown [options] user[:group] file(s)

1. Change the Owner of a File:

      chown newuser filename
	  
2. Change the Group of a File:
	  
	  chown :newgroup filename

3.Change Both the Owner and Group of a File:
     
	  chown newuser:newgroup filename
	  
4. Change the Owner and Group of Multiple Files:

     chown newuser:newgroup file1 fllile2 file3
=============================================================================


================================================================
inode :

an inode (index node) is a data structure that stores metadata about a file or directory. Every file and directory on the filesystem is associated with an inode, which contains important information about the file's attributes and location on disk.


File Metadata:

File type: --  regular file, directory, symbolic link, , etc.
Permissions:   (read, write, execute) for the owner, group, and others.
Owner and Group:    User ID (UID) and group ID (GID)  
Timestamps:  
   Last access time (atime):           Last time the file was accessed.
   Last modification time (mtime):     Last time the file's content was modified.
   Last status change time (ctime):  Last time the file's metadata (permissions, owner, etc.) was changed.
   File Size:                      Size of the file in bytes.
   
   
ls -i   
ll -i 
   
---------------------------------------------------

softlink vs hardlink 

ln srcpath destlink 

ln -s srcpath destlink 


In Linux, both soft links (symbolic links) and hard links are ways to reference files. They serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Let's explore each with examples:

ln -s /path/to/target/file   /path/to/link

ln  /path/to/target/file   /path/to/hardlink


---------------------------------
File manipulations 


cut -d ":" -f 1 /etc/passwd
cut -d ":" -f 1,6 /etc/passwd
cut -d ":" -f 1,2,3,4 /etc/passwd
cut -d ":" -f 1-4 /etc/passwd

cat /etc/passwd | cut -d ":" -f 1,6

=========================================

awk command 


awk  -F":" '{print $1 }' /etc/passwd

 awk -F":" '{print $1 "=" $6}'  /etc/passwd


cat /etc/passwd | awk -F":" '{print $1 "=" $6}'


cat /etc/passwd | awk -F":" '{print $1}'

ON-PREMISES : What is On-Premises?
============================

On-premises means:
You own and manage everything yourself (your own datacenter) 

This includes:
- Servers (big computers)
- Storage
- Networking equipment
- Power
- Cooling
- Security
- IT staff to maintain it


============================
CLOUD : What is Cloud?
============================

Cloud means:
Using someone else’s computers (servers) over the internet
instead of owning and managing your own.


============================
EXAMPLE: Running a Website
============================

ON-PREMISES:

- Buy a server
- Install OS and software
- Set up networking
- Handle power & cooling
- Fix hardware issues
- Upgrade when traffic grows
- Limited storage - External hard drive or  server
- Limited space
- If it breaks → data loss risk

Result:
- Takes time
- High cost
- Requires expertise


CLOUD:

- Create an account
- Click "Create Server"
- Choose server size
- Pay per hour or usage
- Scale up or down anytime AS PER REQUIREMENT 

Result:
- Fast
- Flexible
- Beginner-friendly


============================
KEY BENEFITS OF CLOUD
(Why Cloud is Popular)
============================

- No hardware to buy
- Pay only for what you use (Ondemand )
- Easy to scale resources
- High availability
- High Scalability
- Faster to start
- Global access from anywhere


============================
WHEN ON-PREMISES IS STILL USED
============================

Some companies prefer on-premises when:

- Strict data security laws exist
- Internet is not reliable
- Legacy systems are in use
- Full control over systems is required

UNIX                     Linux
------------------------------------------------
Proprietary              Open-source
Paid                     Free
Limited vendors          Huge community
Less flexible            Highly customizable
Legacy systems           Used everywhere today


=====================================
FEW IMPORTANT FACTS
=====================================

- Android is based on Linux
- AWS runs mostly on Linux
- Google runs on Linux
- Facebook runs on Linux
- Around 90% of internet servers run Linux
- Linux is the backbone of Cloud.

AWS FREE TIER 


AWS Free Tier allows new users to try AWS services
without paying immediately.

It is mainly used for:
- Learning AWS
- Practice
- Small experiments
- Beginners in Cloud


========================================
AWS FREE TIER – CURRENT USAGE MODEL
(NEW ACCOUNTS)
========================================

For new AWS accounts:

- AWS offers a Free Plan with credits
- You can get up to $200 AWS credits
  - $100 at signup
  - Up to $100 by completing learning activities

- Valid for:
  - 6 months
  - OR until credits are used (whichever comes first)

- No charges unless you upgrade to Paid Plan


========================================
IS IT FREE FOR 1 YEAR OR 6 MONTHS?
========================================

- Older AWS accounts (created earlier):
  - Had 12 months Free Tier for many services

- New AWS accounts:
  - Mostly follow 6-month Free Plan with credits

Note:
- AWS model may change over time
- Always check usage limits in AWS console


========================================
ALWAYS FREE SERVICES
(NO EXPIRY – WITH LIMITS)
========================================

Some services are free every month
within certain limits, even after credits end.

Examples:
- AWS Lambda
  - 1 million free requests per month
- Amazon S3
  - Limited free storage
- Amazon DynamoDB
  - Free storage and read/write capacity

(Usage limits apply)


========================================
IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER
========================================

- Credit card is required to create AWS account
- AWS follows pay-as-you-use model
- If you exceed free limits → you will be charged
- Always monitor billing dashboard


========================================
FINAL SUMMARY
========================================

AWS Free Tier is a starter pack for beginners.

- New users get free credits (valid ~6 months)
- Some services are always free within limits
- Best way to learn AWS hands-on
- Be careful with usage to avoid charges

Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):
 
 
The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is a set of guidelines that define the structure and organization of directories and files on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It aims to ensure consistency and compatibility between different distributions of Linux, making it easier for software developers, administrators, and users to navigate and understand the file system. Here are the key components of the FHS:

Root Directory (/)
/bin: Essential command binaries that are required for system operation (e.g., ls, cp, mv).

/boot: Files needed for the boot process, including boot loader configuration files and kernels.

/dev: Device files representing hardware devices attached to the system (e.g., /dev/sda for the first SATA drive).

/etc: Configuration files for the system and installed applications (e.g., /etc/passwd for user information).

/home: Home directories for regular users (e.g., /home/ec2-user).

/lib: Shared libraries needed by programs in /bin and /sbin.

/media: Mount points for removable media (e.g., USB drives).

/mnt: Mount points for temporary mounted filesystems.

/opt: Optional software packages that are not part of the operating system distribution.

/sbin: System binaries essential for system administration, typically used by the root user.

/srv: Data for services provided by the system (e.g., web server data).

/tmp: Temporary files that may be deleted between reboots.

/usr: Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of user utilities and applications.

/var: Variable data files, such as logs, spool files, and temporary files that persist between reboots.

---------------------

root --> /
ll
/bin – binary or executable programs.
 /sbin – binary executable programs for an administrator.
/etc – system configuration files.
/home – home directory. It is the default current directory.
/root - home directory of root user 
/opt – optional or third-party software.
/tmp – temporary space, typically cleared on reboot.
/usr – User related programs.
/var – log files.

=========================================================

df ( disk filesystem)  -
          It is used to report file system disk space usage, showing how much space is used and available on mounted file systems.


df -h 
df -m 

In Windows, drives such as C:, D:, and E: are logical designations assigned to storage devices or partitions. Each drive letter represents a separate filesystem namespace, allowing users and applications to access files and directories on that specific storage unit. 


In Linux, the concept of drive letters like C:, D:, and E: does not exist. Instead, Linux uses a single hierarchical directory structure that begins at the root directory (/). All storage devices, partitions, and network filesystems are integrated into this hierarchy by mounting them at specific directories


df 
df -h
df -m 

----------------------------------------------------------

du -h <foldername/filename>

du -sh 
 
----------------------------------------------------------
change the ownership of files and directories.:


chmod (FILE PERMISSIONS) 

The chmod command in Linux is used to change the file permissions. Permissions dictate who can read, write, or execute a file. Here's a comprehensive guide on using the chmod command:


There are three types of users:

u – the file owner (user)
g – the group to which the file belongs
o – others - everyone else 
a – all (user, group, and others)

------------------
change the permissions of a file or directory --  madhu 

owner/user    |  group  | others 

rwx               rwx     rwx 

r - read - 4
w - write - 2
x - execute - 1 


Modes
Modes can be specified using symbolic or numeric (octal) notation.

Symbolic Notation
r – read permission
w – write permission
x – execute permission



Numeric (Octal) Notation
4 – read permission
2 – write permission
1 – execute permission

The numeric mode is a combination of these values. For example:

7 – read, write, and execute (4 + 2 + 1)
6 – read and write (4 + 2)
5 – read and execute (4 + 1)
4 – read only




chmod -R 


Make a script executable:
Secure private SSH keys:
Set directory to allow access only to owner:
================================================

What is a Group?
A group is a collection of users. It helps manage permissions for multiple users efficiently.

Each file in Linux is owned by:

One user (owner)

One group

==========================================
/etc/passwd	------   Stores user info (usernames, UID, shell, home)
/etc/group	-------  Lists groups and their members
/etc/shadow	------    Stores encrypted passwords
==================================================================
Shared Directory for Team::

groupadd team
usermod -aG team madhu
usermod -aG team kiran
mkdir /project
chown root:team /project
chmod 770 /project

======================================

CHOWN :

change the ownership of files and directories.

FILE & DIRECTORY OWNERSHIP :

The chown command in Linux is used to change the ownership of files and directories. This command allows you to change both the user and group ownership of a file or directory.

chown [options] user[:group] file(s)

1. Change the Owner of a File:

      chown newuser filename
	  
2. Change the Group of a File:
	  
	  chown :newgroup filename

3.Change Both the Owner and Group of a File:
     
	  chown newuser:newgroup filename
	  
4. Change the Owner and Group of Multiple Files:

     chown newuser:newgroup file1 fllile2 file3
=============================================================================


================================================================
inode :

an inode (index node) is a data structure that stores metadata about a file or directory. Every file and directory on the filesystem is associated with an inode, which contains important information about the file's attributes and location on disk.


File Metadata:

File type: --  regular file, directory, symbolic link, , etc.
Permissions:   (read, write, execute) for the owner, group, and others.
Owner and Group:    User ID (UID) and group ID (GID)  
Timestamps:  
   Last access time (atime):           Last time the file was accessed.
   Last modification time (mtime):     Last time the file's content was modified.
   Last status change time (ctime):  Last time the file's metadata (permissions, owner, etc.) was changed.
   File Size:                      Size of the file in bytes.
   
   
ls -i   
ll -i 
   
---------------------------------------------------

softlink vs hardlink 

ln srcpath destlink 

ln -s srcpath destlink 


In Linux, both soft links (symbolic links) and hard links are ways to reference files. They serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Let's explore each with examples:

ln -s /path/to/target/file   /path/to/link

ln  /path/to/target/file   /path/to/hardlink

WHAT IS SHELL SCRIPT & WHY SHELL SCRIPT ?

A shell script is a file with a set of shell commands , for Automation of Repetetive tasks . (extention with .sh ) 

What is a variable ?

a variable is a charecter string to which we assign a value. The value assigned could be a number , text , filename , device or any other type of Data .  Simply its a pointer / reference to actual data .


SHELL SCRIPTING  FOR   AUTOMATION & TO MINIMIZE REPETETIVE TASKS

HASH-BANG  OR SHEBANG

#!/bin/bash
#!/bin/sh
#!/bin/dash


The shebang line, 
starts with #! followed by the path to the interpreter that should be used to execute the script.
